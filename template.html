      <h2>What is this?</h2>
      <p>
        This website provides RSS feeds for
        <a href="https://mycrossword.co.uk">MyCrossword</a> to notify solvers
        when their favourite setters publish new puzzles. This site is not
        affiliated with MyCrossword and is maintained for the community by
        setter Dyno.
      </p>
      <h2>What is RSS?</h2>
      <p>
        An RSS feed is a summary of the content on a website. An app called a
        feed reader allows you to subscribe to feeds and displays
        newly-published content for you to browse at your leisure. See this

        for the benefits. Free and paid feed readers are available for all
        devices, as well as on the web and as browser extensions.

      <h2>What feeds are available here?</h2>
      <p>

        10 most recent puzzles from each setter. Just right-click "copy link"
        on the feed icon and paste into your feed reader.
